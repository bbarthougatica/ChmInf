This branch contains the colab notebooks used for the regression task as well as the uploaded datasets that were used to test different import methods. 
The actual files used in the report are 'cheminf latin', that contains the random forest and MLP models for all descriptors for the regression task. On the other hand, the GNN_lipo 
file containes the GNN model used for a graph descriptor. In this last file, there seems to be an error with the preview, due to native metadata widgets that are used in the notebook
In order to get around this issue, it is just required to download the file to your personal device, and then upload it directly to your platform of use to view the model and results.
