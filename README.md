At first sight, the repository might seem unorganized and with lots of files, but that is the intended plan, as the organization changed as we evolved with the project. 

Since the idea of the hub is for you to be able to see all the processes we've been through, we have not removed any of the files we've worked with, even if we stopped using them 
or reorganized it.

For practical use, the hub is pretty intuitve, there are three branches that are used. Regarding the 'main' branch, it's only used to explain the functioning of the branches, any other files were us learning our way.

Regression & Classification branches, contain the actual final colab notebooks used for the report. Classification_draft was another branch that we created originally but ended up  shifting to other places. 
The main files are the following:

Regression:
* 'cheminf latin.ipynb' that contains the random forest and MLP models for all descriptors for the regression task.
* 'GNN_lipo.ipynb' file containes the GNN model used for a graph descriptor. In this last file, there seems to be an error with the preview, due to native metadata widgets that are used in the notebook. In order to get around this issue, it is just required to download the file to your personal device, and then upload it directly to your platform of use to view the model and results.

Classification:
* 'cheminf_latin.ipynb' contains the whole procedure for the classification task using the random forest multioutput classifier.
* 'MLP model for class.ipynb' contains the MLP model for the classification task
