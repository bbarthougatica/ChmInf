GNNs rely on [message passing methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212), which means that nodes exchange information with the neighbors, and send \"messages\" to each other. Generally, GNNs operate in two phases: a **message passing** phase, which transmits information across the molecule to build a neural representation of the molecule, and a **readout** phase, which uses the final representation of the molecule to make predictions about the properties of interest."

The [torch_geometric.nn](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html) module of PyG contains many different types of layers for message passing and readout, which can help us define GNN models more conveniently."
