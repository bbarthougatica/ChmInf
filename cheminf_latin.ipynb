It provides a set of libraries and tools for the manipulation and analysis of molecular structures, molecular descriptors, molecular fingerprints, molecular similarity, molecular visualization, and more. The toolkit is widely used in academia, as well as in the pharmaceutical, biotech, and chemical industries for a variety of tasks such as virtual screening, lead optimization, and chemical database management."
